# entropy-pooling

This library contains the Python function library for running entropy pooling of market scenarios for portfolio optimization goals.

Rough structure sketch of the code library

1) main file that is used to run the entropy pooling procedure

2) function(s) for uploading and preprocessing the data from xlsx file into views

3) function(s) for performing the entropy minizination to find posterior scenario probabilities

4) function(s) for performing the Markowitz portfolio optimization task to find optimal allocations

5) function(s) for visualization and computing some summary statistics

Extra: Jupyter notebook etc to create a basis for some daily (or weekly/monthly) run report
